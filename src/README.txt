Fanorona is a strategy board game for two players that comes from Madagascar.
Briefly,

 - Each player has 22 chips (black or white) and the white chips play first.
 - The player that captures all the opponent's chips wins.
 - A player may capture an opponent's chip by approaching it or withdrawing from it.
 - When a player captures a chip, all the subsequent chips in the same direction
   are also captured so long as they are not separated by a chip of another color or a space.
 - Two consecutive moves in the same direction are not allowed as well as stepping on the same
   position twice in a single turn

A more detailed description of the rules can be found at:

To use this application simply click on a white chip and then a space to move it.
Afterwards, the agent will make a move. If you can't select another chip it may be
because you are still in turn (you could possibly capture another chip)
and you must make a move, but remember you can't go back to a previous position nor
play twice in the same direction consecutively.

Note: The agent performs it's moves instantly, but they are all valid
